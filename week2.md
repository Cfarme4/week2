# Week 2 Outline

## Review

- [ ] Introductions
- [ ] Syllabus Overview and Questions
	- Assignments due Fridays at _noon_ each week.
	- Class will focus on pragmatics of computing.
- [ ] The Linux Virtual Machine
	- May be easiest to use separate VMs at home and in lab
	- Can move files back and forth with flash drive or OneDrive
- [ ] GitHub and Homework
	- Repositories
	- Pull Requests
- [ ] Markdown and Outlines
	- Can take notes directly in file - maybe use block quotes?
	- In Atom, install these packages:
		1. `markdown-preview`
		2. `language-markdown`
		3. Toggle preview on and off with Shift-Ctrl-M

> This is a block quote.
> This might be an easy way to add your own notes.<br>
> To write notes on new lines, add two empty spaces or `<br>` at the end of a line.

## Filesystem Structure

- [ ] Review last week's exercise
	- Recreate files and folders, if necessary

```
 ~/Desktop/Biology/
				CellBiology/
				Ecology/
				Evolution/
					PopulationGenetics/
						ImportantTopics.txt
					Phylogenetics/
```

- [ ] The Unix root - /
	- The very base of the filesystem

- [ ] Absolute paths
	- All absolute paths begin at the root

- [ ] Relative paths
	- Working directories
	- Shortcuts for current and parent directories

- [ ] Hidden files and folders
	- Names begin with `.`
	- Usually used for configuration files

```
Filesystem Exercise

1. Based on the directory structure above, find the Population Genetics folder.
2. Write the absolute path to that folder.
3. If Population Genetics is your working directory, write the relative path to the Phylogenetics folder.
4. If Biology is your working directory, write the relative path to Phylogenetics

```

## Practical Computing Advice

- [ ] Naming files and folders
	- camelCase
	- `underscores_can_work`
- [ ] Plain text files
	- Human readable
	- ASCII and UniCode
		- [ASCII on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
		- [UTF-8 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [ ] New line characters
	- [New Lines on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)
- [ ] Activity Monitor
	- CPU Activity
	- Memory
	- Disk spaces
	- Jobs and IDs
